# Test Driven Development

## Traditional Testing: 
 - Developer write the code and then the tests are written
## Test Driven Development
 - First write the test and then write the code
 - If your code fail certain tests, then you refactor the code and test again

## Advantage TDD over traditional testing 
- In traditional testing some test cases are left to cover but in TDD, we get complete coverage. In TDD , you write the test first without thinking of your code and try to complete all the test cases. Then you write the code

- Clear understanding of the requirements
